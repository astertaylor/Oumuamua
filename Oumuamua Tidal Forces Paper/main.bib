    abstract = "{We present the first attempt to fit the light curve of the interstellar visitor ‘Oumuamua using a physical model that includes optional torque. We consider both conventional (Lommel–Seeliger triaxial ellipsoid) and alternative (‘black-and-white ball’, ‘solar sail’) brightness models. With all the brightness models, some torque is required to explain the timings of the most conspicuous features – deep minima – of the asteroid’s light curve. Our best-fitting models are a thin disc (aspect ratio 1:6) and a thin cigar (aspect ratio 1:8) that are very close to being axially symmetric. Both models are tumbling and require some torque that has the same amplitude in relation to ‘Oumuamua’s linear non-gravitational acceleration as in Solar system comets whose dynamics is affected by outgassing. Assuming random orientation of the angular momentum vector, we compute probabilities for our best-fitting models. We show that cigar-shaped models suffer from a fine-tuning problem and have only 16 per cent probability to produce light-curve minima as deep as the ones present in ‘Oumuamua’s light curve. Disc-shaped models, on the other hand, are very likely (at 91 per cent) to produce minima of the required depth. From our analysis, the most likely model for ‘Oumuamua is a thin disc (slab) experiencing moderate torque from outgassing.}",

abstract = {This work presents two software components aimed to relieve the costs of accessing high-performance parallel computing resources within a Python programming environment: MPI for Python and PETSc for Python. MPI for Python is a general-purpose Python package that provides bindings for the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard using any back-end MPI implementation. Its facilities allow parallel Python programs to easily exploit multiple processors using the message passing paradigm. PETSc for Python provides access to the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) libraries. Its facilities allow sequential and parallel Python applications to exploit state of the art algorithms and data structures readily available in PETSc for the solution of large-scale problems in science and engineering. MPI for Python and PETSc for Python are fully integrated to PETSc-FEM, an MPI and PETSc based parallel, multiphysics, finite elements code developed at CIMEC laboratory. This software infrastructure supports research activities related to simulation of fluid flows with applications ranging from the design of microfluidic devices for biochemical analysis to modeling of large-scale stream/aquifer interactions.}

abstract = {We examine the physical interactions between material in the Oort Cloud and the interstellar medium (ISM). The model employed here accounts for sputtering, sticking, and grain-impact erosion, as well as gas drag. The model represents the ISM as a multiphase medium with two cloud-phase regimes (atomic and molecular) and two gas-phase regimes (coronal and warm/ambient). The effects of both supernova remnants and stellar winds on the Oort Cloud are also evaluated. It is found that erosion is the dominant ISM interaction. Owing to the spatial inhomogeneities in the ISM, the erosion rate is highly time variable, with essentially all erosion taking place during brief encounters with atomic and molecular clouds. Depending on the actual mechanical and surface roughness properties of cometary surfaces, 60–600 g cm−2 of material may have been lost from each comet or smaller object. ISM drag effects were found to efficiently remove submicron particles from the Cloud. Either by direct ejection or through drag forces, eroded debris particles will be lost from the Oort Cloud to the ISM. Erosion reduces the effectiveness of the thermal and radiation damage processes acting on cometary surfaces in the Oort Cloud.}

	abstract = {The first interstellar object observed in our solar system, 1I/2017 U1 (‘Oumuamua), exhibited a number of peculiar properties, including extreme elongation and acceleration excess. Recently, Seligman & Laughlin proposed that the object was made out of molecular hydrogen (H2) ice. The question is whether H2 objects could survive their travel from the birth sites to the solar system. Here we study destruction processes of icy H2 objects through their journey from giant molecular clouds (GMCs) to the interstellar medium (ISM) and the solar system, owing to interstellar radiation, gas and dust, and cosmic rays. We find that thermal sublimation due to heating by starlight can destroy ‘Oumuamua-size objects in less than 10 Myr. Thermal sublimation by collisional heating in GMCs could destroy H2 objects of ‘Oumuamua-size before their escape into the ISM. Most importantly, the formation of icy grains rich in H2 is unlikely to occur in dense environments because collisional heating raises the temperature of the icy grains, so that thermal sublimation rapidly destroys the H2 mantle before grain growth.}

	abstract = {Observations of the first interstellar minor object 1I/2017 ’Oumuamua did not reveal direct signs of outgassing that would have been natural if it had a volatile-rich composition. However, a recent measurement by Micheli et al. of a substantial non-gravitational acceleration affecting the orbit of this object has been interpreted as resulting from its cometary activity, which must be rather vigorous. Here we critically reassess this interpretation by exploring the implications of measured non-gravitational acceleration for ’Oumuamua’s rotational state. We show that outgassing torques should drive the rapid evolution of ’Oumuamua’s spin (on a timescale of a few days), assuming torque asymmetry that is typical for solar system comets. However, given the highly elongated shape of the object, its torque asymmetry is likely higher, implying an even faster evolution. This would have resulted in rapid rotational fission of ’Oumuamua during its journey through the solar system, and is clearly incompatible with the relative stability of its rotational state inferred from photometric variability. Based on these arguments, as well as the lack of direct signs of outgassing, we conclude that the classification of ’Oumuamua as a comet (invoked to explain its claimed anomalous acceleration) is questionable.}

	journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
	abstract = {Object 1I/2017 U1 (‘Oumuamua) is the first interstellar small body ever discovered in the solar system. By the time of discovery, it had already passed perihelion. To investigate the behavior of ‘Oumuamua around perihelion, we searched for it in Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) images from early 2017 September (preperihelion), but did not detect it. The nondetection of ‘Oumuamua by STEREO renders more stringent constraints on its physical properties thanks to the extreme forward-scattering observing geometry. Assuming a geometric albedo of pV = 0.1, the effective scattering cross-section of any dust coma was m2. Assuming that it behaved like a typical solar system comet, this would correspond to a total mass of ≲20 ± 2 kg and a water production rate of ≲(6.1 ± 0.5) × 1025 s−1 at a heliocentric distance of rH = 0.375 au. If scaled to post-discovery rH, the water production rate would be smaller than any of the previously reported upper limits by at least an order of magnitude. To exhibit the reported nongravitational motion with our default assumptions requires a nucleus bulk density ≲40 kg m−3; higher bulk densities are possible for other assumptions. Alternatively, we show that thermal fracturing could have plausibly removed an inert surface layer between these observations and discovery, thus initiating activity after ‘Oumuamua left the field of view of STEREO.}
